Description
Have you ever seen one of those puzzles where you have to try and fit a collection of various shapes into a certain area?
The Pentomino was first devised by American professor Solomon Golomb in 1953. A Pentomino is a single polygon made up of 5 congruent squares. A full set of Pentominos consists of all 12 of the possible combinations of the 5 squares (excluding reflections and rotations).
Pentominos have the special property of being able to be packed into many different shapes. For example, with a full set of 12 Pentominos, you could create a rectangle of size 6x10, 5x12, 4x15, and 3x20. Other smaller shapes can be made, but with less Pentominos. Additionally, you can also fill an 8x8 square with 4 holes in it (although certain positions of the holes can make it impossible).
The challenge is to output one solution for the given rectangle.
